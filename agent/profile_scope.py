"""
Per-profile runtime scope — shared between gateway and cron.

The multiplexing gateway serves many profiles from one process. Each profile
has its own ``HERMES_HOME`` (config / skills / memory / SOUL / sessions) and
its own ``.env`` (provider keys and platform tokens), so a per-turn handler
must redirect BOTH before any work that touches either.

This module hosts the single context-manager both the gateway inbound path
and the cron scheduler wrap their work in. Hosting it here (not in
``gateway.run``) breaks the natural ``gateway → cron`` import direction so
the cron scheduler can enter the same scope without a circular import —
every consumer of this scope is symmetric, so the seam lives at the lowest
practical layer.

Design rationale: ``docs/design/multiplexing-gateway.md`` (Workstream A).

def profile_runtime_scope(profile_home: "Path"):

    Combines the two seams the multiplexer needs:

      1. ``set_hermes_home_override`` — redirects ``get_hermes_home()``
         (config, skills, memory, SOUL, sessions) to the profile's home.
         Contextvar, so it propagates into the agent worker thread via
         ``copy_context()``.

      2. ``set_secret_scope`` — installs the profile's ``.env`` secrets as
         the authoritative credential source, so ``get_secret`` reads this
         profile's keys and never the process-global ``os.environ`` (which
         in a multiplexer may hold another profile's values).

    Used by the multiplexed inbound path AND the cron scheduler. Single-
    profile gateways and single-profile cron deployments skip the scope
    entirely, so their behavior is unchanged. Loading the profile's
    ``.env`` here does NOT mutate ``os.environ`` —
    ``build_profile_secret_scope`` returns an isolated dict — which is
    what keeps subprocesses (MCP, kanban, no_agent cron scripts) from
    inheriting cross-profile secrets.

    Args:
        profile_home: Absolute path to the profile's HERMES_HOME
            (e.g. ``~/.hermes/profiles/yangyang/`` or ``~/.hermes/`` for
            the default profile).
